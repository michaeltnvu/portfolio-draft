            <h3 class="centerText">About Me</h3>
            <p>After graduation from San Jose State University, I became a bookkeeper for a few companies in the Silicon Valley. My girlfriend and I relocated to South Florida in 2019 so she can attend medical school. With so much change happening I decided to pursue something different for myself as well. I am now seeking a new career path in software engineering and my first step was to enroll in <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/">Thinkful</a>'s engineering bootcamp.</p>

            <p>Software engineering, or web development in particular, is a craft that     directly reflects how much time you devote to it. It is a profession where learning never stops. The best part - for me, at least - is that you get to experience the highs and the lows of tackling the biggest challenges in a team environment.</p>

            <p>Outside of development here are the top 3 things I enjoy: </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Barbering</li>
              <li>Brewing my own coffee (drinking black is awesome)</li>
              <li>Playing organized basketball</li>
            </ol>
